# Movie-Recommender-System

1. Data Collection
Task 1.1: Gather movie data from sources like MovieLens, IMDb, or other datasets.
Task 1.2: Import necessary libraries for data handling (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).
Task 1.3: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Preprocessing
Task 2.1: Clean the dataset (handle missing values, remove duplicates).
Task 2.2: Normalize/Standardize data if necessary.
Task 2.3: Encode categorical variables (e.g., genres).
Task 2.4: Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Task 3.1: Perform descriptive statistics on the data.
Task 3.2: Visualize data distributions and relationships (e.g., movie ratings, genres).
4. Model Selection and Training
Task 4.1: Choose the type of recommendation system (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid).
Task 4.2: Implement collaborative filtering using matrix factorization (e.g., SVD) or nearest-neighbors algorithms.
Task 4.3: Implement content-based filtering using feature vectors for movies.
Task 4.4: Train the model(s) on the training data.
5. Model Evaluation
Task 5.1: Evaluate the model(s) using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or precision@k, recall@k.
Task 5.2: Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Task 5.3: Compare the performance of different models if multiple models are used.
6. Recommendation Generation
Task 6.1: Create functions to generate movie recommendations for users.
Task 6.2: Ensure the recommendations are diverse and relevant.
7. Deployment
Task 7.1: Create a simple user interface for the recommendation system (e.g., web application using Flask or Django).
Task 7.2: Deploy the recommendation system to a server or cloud platform.
Task 7.3: Ensure the system is scalable and can handle a large number of users.
